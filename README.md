# KHALID EL MOUSSAOUI WEBPAGE

My project is based on resume/portfolio style page which it serves the purpose to attract potential customers who will want me to work with/for them.

UX
The user experience is engaging achieving this by making a simple and easy website. 
The website is mainly focused for potential customers or recruiters who want to hire my services that I provide. 

Features

Forms: User will be required to enter details in the form to submit the contact however only 3 field are required (phone number is optional)
I left to implement a Multilanguage site as I may be adding my page into another extra two different languages (Spanish and Arabic)

Technologies Used.

I have used Boostrap to add extra styling to my webpage.

Testing
Social Media Links: 
1.	Click in a link
2.	This should take you to the relevant social media website
3.	It should open the website in a new tab in your browser
Contact form:
1.	Go to contact page 
2.	Try to submit the information by leaving the required fields empty (this will give a massage error)
3.	Input correct data and you should see that it sends the request correctly. 
My Website works different depending whether if its displayed on mobile or desktop. Main difference is my profile image that it disappears on a mobile same as the side bar. 
The link for the social media are also included with text on mobile mode.
